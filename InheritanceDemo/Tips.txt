i> Inheritance

-Inheritance is to  extend something that doesnot mean you try to inherit everything
- To know whether to inherit or not, validate is a realationship.
	ex: A Corola is a car. Corola inherits from Car but if we inherit JCB from Car then it doesnot
	satisfy JCB is a Car. Therfore inheritance is not always the right approach
-Everything parent class must be applicable for child class in order to inherit
-Dont try to inherit everything 
- If the thing that you want to inherit doesnot fits in then dont inherit
-                   public class Phone 
                        {

                            public void PlaceCall()
                            {

                            }

                            public void EndCall()
                            {

                            }
                        }

    //Dont inherit walkie talkie from phone. Even if the walkie talkie allows is applicable to call both method that phone has(place and end call)
    //Even if we can inherit from it we should not inherit beacuse a walkie talkie is not a cell phone
                            public class WalkieTalkie : Phone
                            {

                            }
